# Hugo Basic Starter for TailwindCSS v3.x and Sass

A very simple starter set up with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and its [typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and a build setup using [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com/).

A modified version of [bep/hugo-starter-tailwind-basic](https://github.com/bep/hugo-starter-tailwind-basic), just with Sass.

This setup has only been tested with projects; it might work as a theme but idk.

## As a Project

Create a repo from this template, install the dependencies, and run.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
